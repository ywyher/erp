# is db initalaized each time we route ?
# return to the old one and log it lol

# presets for all doctors at once ?

# when updating the operation document make the preset choice better its now ass

# Transfer patient with approval request from the admin

# 'use cache' !!

# Posts tags in post card

# doctors should be able to create posts of the category article only not the news 
# if so the articles written by doctors need to be verified by an admin first
# so we need a verified field and createdBy field to determine
# and another pending approval page for the admin to see the doctors articles that are pending approval
# would be call if we have a notificatoin system for that so we add it later

# add an author data column in the posts table

# maybe cache the header query ??

# add stat component but by date instead of total of all time

# add reading duration to posts

# the editor when deleting the image with backspace it doesnt get delete from the bucket
# the undo parrt too

# Rather than your junky formFieldWrapper component make it just have the form skeleton and accept children and for each field u want make a seperate component

# basic pagination for booking/employees components (real one not just slicing them)

# useMediaQuery hook and change the maxItemPerPage for the pagination system depending on the device !!

<!-- Priorty 0 -->

# add the ability for the patient to add personal data like whiehg height and so onn

# Notification system for when an appoinment/operation or completed or something not sure yet (priorty -> 0)

# check if drizzle-studio have a way to make records appears as if they arent there and maybe make a request for it if not

# Ability for the doctor to upload his certificates

# home page

# laboratories/radiologies/medicines real data

# for operation document there should be default datas despite the document content example:

# {

# column - value

# user: userName,

# age: userAge,

# // so on

# }

# so if the document has these columns in it it should be set if not who cares

# for operation document there should be the ability to upload a different document for each role (doctor/nurse/receptionist)
